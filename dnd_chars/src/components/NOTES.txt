1. Class Proficiencies (Paladin)
By default, Paladins are proficient in:

Armor: All armor, shields
Weapons: Simple and martial weapons
Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma
Skills: You choose two from: Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion.
2. Background Proficiencies (Guard)
Since "Guard" isn't an official 5e background, it's likely a homebrew or a re-skin of City Watch (from Sword Coast Adventurer‚Äôs Guide), which gives:

Skills: Athletics, Insight
Tool Proficiency: One type of gaming set, Vehicles (land)
If "Guard" is different in your campaign, you might want to check with your DM.

3. Racial Proficiencies (Human)
Regular Humans don‚Äôt get extra proficiencies.
Variant Human gets one skill proficiency of your choice.
You mentioned Lucky, which means you are a Variant Human. This gives you:

One skill proficiency (your choice)
A feat (Lucky)
4. Feat (Lucky)
The Lucky feat doesn‚Äôt grant any proficiencies, but it lets you reroll dice three times per long rest.
5. Skills Based on Your Info

Athletics (From Guard)
Insight (From Guard)
One skill of your choice (From Variant Human)
Two skills from Paladin list (Choose from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, Religion)
6. Acrobatic Proficiency

Haste yourself = 2 attacks + Smite + crazy movement.
Save Spell Slots for Smite unless casting something game-changing.
